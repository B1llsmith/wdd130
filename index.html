    <p>Hello! My name is Billsmith Juma and I am from Nairobi, Kenya. I enjoy learning to code, even if it’s tricky
      sometimes.
      When I finally get my code to work, it feels amazing, like solving a puzzle. Sure, I make mistakes and see a lot
      of error messages, but each one teaches me something new.
      I may be just starting, but every little success keeps me excited to learn more.

    <p>Nairobi, the capital city of Kenya, is a vibrant and bustling metropolis that blends modernity with rich cultural
      heritage.
      Known as the "Green City in the Sun," it is surrounded by natural beauty, including the nearby Nairobi National
      Park, where wildlife roams against a backdrop of skyscrapers.
      As East Africa's economic hub, Nairobi boasts a thriving business district, world-class infrastructure, and a
      diverse population that contributes to its dynamic arts, music, and culinary scenes.
      The city's history is deeply tied to Kenya's independence movement, making it a cultural and political cornerstone
      in the region.
